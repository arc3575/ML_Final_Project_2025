This is a final project that I completed for a graduate course in machine learning. The objective of the project is to create a classifier pipeline capable of predicting drug-induced autoimmune responses in clinical trial patients using physiochemical predictive variables.

The full report is contained in the pdf file, in the repository.

The visualizations have also been uploading and are in a labeled folder. 

The code used to generate the analysis is in a jupyter notebook, uploading to the repository.


The models applied in this analysis are:

1. Principal Component Analysis 

2. Linear Discriminant Analysis

3. Random Forests

4. XGBoost

5. Logistic Regression 

6. Support Vector Machine (multiple kernels)




```python

```
